# RootKeys-Update-LoRaWAN-Based-IoT-Applications
Development of an algorithm that, via API, sends HTTP PUT requests to LoRaWAN devices connected to the network to perform perioding updating of root-keys, as they are installed in IoT devices during fabrication and never changed
Results: The realized system provides on the one hand an alternative to the security mechanisms already in place, and on the other hand an increase in the overall security of the network.
